    <h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>1.1 | Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">Our society lives online. Without technology, interaction with customer base, streamlined communication, and optimal operational capacity – and therefore revenue would be compromised.
<br>
<br>
Technology allows businesses to reach a wider customer base, develop relationships, streamline operations, provide better customer service and support relationships with key partners.
</p>
<br>
<h3>1.2 | Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">In order to execute a project successfully, planning, delegating, tracking, reviewing and measuring results are required throughout the process.
<br>
<br>
Collaboration, communication skills, a problem-solving attitude, attention to detail, strong organisational skills, the ability to multi-task and prioritise, goal-setting, tech literacy are all crucial to the successful completion of projects. 
<br>
<br>
A methodical approach should be taken, with collaborative software and cloud-based technology used to ensure everything is logged as you progress.
</p>
<br>
<br> 
<h3>1.3 | Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">I will use Trello to manage each stage of the build effectively, and ensure I am comprehensive in my thought process and approach.

    For the copy I will use Word in Google Drive. The copy for the website will be divided into headers – Home, Unit 1, Unit 2 and Contact Me
<br>    
    I intend to use Slack to manage each sections:-

<h3>1.4 | Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">It’s important to mitigate against risk, such as cost and schedule risk, respectively. The risks that might impact digital project might include:
<br>
<br>
    The customer may not know what they want initially, so may request multiple changes which could delay the delivery of the project. This would have cost implications for both parties. If you don’t create and agree a design plan in advance, and fail to draw up a contract that sets the parameters of your relationship with the customer in order to manage everyone’s expectations, this could set the project back and eat into the budget. 
<br>
<br>
    Spending too long on one task might derail the project schedule. Examples of this might include spending too much time speaking with individual customers would be one such example. Another example of this is dedicating large amounts of time than is necessary to work that is already good enough.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>1.5 | Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">One needs to establish the ambitions, complexity of the project and budget in order to choose the most appropriate technology stacks, and also to establish what is most efficient to complete your task. An example of two technology stacks would be M.E.A.N (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node); or L.A.M.P (Linux, Apache, Mysql and Php). 
<br>
<br>
One would need to manage the project with time tracking, project management and documentation systems.
</p>
<br>
<h3>1.6 | Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">Trello allows you to break down tasks into bite size chunks, allowing you track each task as you complete them. This would allow you to account for how much time is allocated to each task, to ensure that you keep your project on schedule and on budget.
<br>
<br>
Trello has helped me become more organised with my projects, especially when I start working with it again the next day, I can look back at my Trello and through the KanBan method of (To do, Doing and Done) I get to specifically see what I've done, what I need to do and where I'm up to. 
<br>
Git can be used in the same way to track project changes, creating an audit chain. It facilitates peer review and joint responsibility.
<br>
<br>
Github, on the other hand has helped me publish my projects to an online portfolio, for employers and the general public to see to promote my knowledge and skills learnt. Overall - there is a theme of using multiple software applications etc as, although, they may not have anything specifically to do with one another, I can use them both to my advantage to create and then broadcast my digital projects.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.7 | Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">The GDPR was adopted in 2016 and took effect in 2018. The regulation protects people’s personal data throughout the EU and also affects data exports from the EU.
    GDPR was designed to give citizens control over their personal data. 
<br>
<br>
Another example is the right to be forgotten. This legal guideline, put into practice since 2006, allows citizens to request the removal of personal information from online sources.
<br>
<br>
People and companies who don’t comply with the GDPR law may face fines of up to 20 million euros, or 4% of a company’s profits from the previous year.</p>
