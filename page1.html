    <h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 1</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>1.1 | Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">Our society lives online. Without technology, interaction with customer base, streamlined communication, and optimal operational capacity – and therefore revenue would be compromised.
<br>
<br>
Technology allows businesses to reach a wider customer base, develop relationships, streamline operations, provide better customer service and support relationships with key partners.
</p>
<br>
<h3>1.2 | Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">In order to execute a project successfully, planning, delegating, tracking, reviewing and measuring results are required throughout the process.
<br>
<br>
Collaboration, communication skills, a problem-solving attitude, attention to detail, strong organisational skills, the ability to multi-task and prioritise, goal-setting, tech literacy are all crucial to the successful completion of projects. 
<br>
<br>
A methodical approach should be taken, with collaborative software and cloud-based technology used to ensure everything is logged as you progress.
</p>
<br>
<br> 
<h3>1.3 | Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">I will use Trello to manage each stage of the build effectively, and ensure I am comprehensive in my thought process and approach.
<br>
    To do
    Not doing anymore
    Completed tasks
<br>    
    For the copy I will use Word in Google Drive. The copy for the website will be divided into headers – Home, Unit 1, Unit 2 and Contact Me
<br>    
    I intend to use Slack to manage each sections:-
    Eg
    Code
    Design
    Copy
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/lw92pvgb/website/" target="_blank">Link to Trello board</a> 
     </p>
<br>
<br> 
<h3>1.4 | Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">It’s important to mitigate against risk, such as cost risk and schedule risk.
<br>
Spending too long on one task might derail the project schedule.
<br>
Data migration issues
<br>
The customer may request changes which sets the project back</p>
<br>
<h3>1.5 | Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">If you are working on the go then portable IT systems such as mobile phones and laptops will be essential in terms of travel, whereas if you only work at a desk in work then a desktop PC would be appropriate also.
In terms of software, depending on the project in hand that you've been set, you'll need to look at specific apps and programs that cater to those requirements in order to use them effectively,  accurately and efficiently. I.e - if you're a front end developer and been set the task of creating a website, you can use VS Code then front end languages such as HTML and CSS.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.6 | Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">Trello has helped me become more organised with my projects, especially when I start working with it again the next day, I can look back at my Trello and through the KanBan method of (To do, Doing and Done) I get to specifically see what I've done, what I need to do and where I'm up to. 
<br>
<br>
Github, on the other hand has helped me publish my projects to an online portfolio, for employers and the general public to see to promote my knowledge and skills learnt. Overall - there is a theme of using multiple software applications etc as, although, they may not have anything specifically to do with one another, I can use them both to my advantage to create and then broadcast my digital projects</p>
<br>
<h3>1.7 | Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
<br>
<p class="outcome1">GDPR or The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. It was implemented in May 2018.
<br>
<br>
    The GDPR sets out seven principles for the lawful processing of personal data. Processing includes the collection, organisation, structuring, storage, alteration, consultation, use, communication, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data. Broadly, the seven principles are:
    <br>
    -Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
    <br>
    -Purpose limitation
    <br>
    -Data minimisation
    <br>
    -Accuracy
    <br>
    -Storage limitation
    <br>
    -Integrity and confidentiality (security)
    <br>
    -Accountability
    <br>
    <br>
    The principles are at the centre of the GDPR; they are the guiding principles of the regulation and compliant processing.
    <br>
    Data controllers are responsible for complying with the principles and letter of the regulation. Data Controllers are also accountable for their processing and must demonstrate their compliance. This is set out in the new accountability principle.
    <br>
    The full version of the seven principles gives more detail about the principles and their application.
    <br>
    <br>
    Personal data shall be:
    <br>
    "(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);
    <br>
    (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
    <br>
    (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
    <br>
    (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
    <br>
    (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);
    <br>
    (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’)."
    <br>
    <br>
    Examples of a breach might include:
    loss or theft of hard copy notes, USB drives, computers or mobile devices
    an unauthorised person gaining access to your laptop, email account or computer network
    sending an email with personal data to the wrong person
    a bulk email using 'to' or 'cc', but where 'bcc' (blind carbon-copy) should have been used
    a disgruntled employee copying a list of contacts for their personal use
    a break-in at the office where personnel files are kept in unlocked storage
    <br>
    <br>
    In 2018, the ICO has issued a notice of its intention to fine British Airways £183.39m for infringements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    <br>
    The proposed fine related to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 2</h4>
<br>
<h3>2.1 | Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
<p class="outcome2">
    I mainly used Visual Studio Code for my website project. It was very fast and easy to use. Trello allowed me to keep on top of individual tasks. I sourced new CSS rules from the internet.
</p>
<br>
<h3>2.2 | Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Visual Studio Code was easy to use. I built the structure of the website with html and then styled it with a layer of css. 
</p>
</body>
</html>
<br>
<h3>2.3 | Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> I’m happy with the layout and colour scheme. However, it is still more basic than I would have liked because I’m new to html and css. I would have changed the font. 
</p>
</body>
</html>
<br>
<h3>2.4 | Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Visual Studio Code was easy to use. I built the structure of the website with html and then styled it with a layer of css. 
</p>
</body>
</html>
<br>
<h3>2.5 | Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Unsure what is meant here.

<h4>Unit 1 - Outcome 3</h4>
<br>
<h3>3.1 | Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p class="outcome2">Given that I have no previous experience of building a website, there are benefits to working in a team on the website project. I found this particularly useful with the game we devised, because cohort members were able to demonstrate how to write lines of code to those with no previous experience.

    However because of the personal nature of the website, there were benefits to doing this task alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It meant I could apply the styles and shape it in a way that I liked and that reflected my tastes, as well as encouraging independent learning.
    <br>
    The cohort has been useful for sharing code, so I would have drawn on this shared knowledge more in retrospect.    
</p>
<br>
<h3>3.2 | Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p class="outcome2">On reflection, I would have done more preparation by way of research into the layout and design of the website template. I could have done this by collating a list of references to websites that I thought were effective. I would have done more research on user journey and functionality.

    Peer review would have also been beneficial, as well as showing friends and family for an objective point of view. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In terms of efficiency I could have worked out a schedule for each task that contributed to building the website. I would have dedicated a certain amount of time to each task.

<h3>3.3 | Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> 
</p>

<br>
<h3>3.4 | Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<p class="outcome2">I would have sought more support from my cohort. I don’t know how Slack would have helped me.

<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 1</h4>
<br>
<h3>1.1 | Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p class="outcome2">Insert answer here  
</p>
<br>
<h3>1.5 | Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
<p class="outcome2">Finding stock objects is often quicker, cheaper and more practical than producing your own.
<br> 
<br>
Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual property. It allows the copyright owner to protect against others copying or reproducing their work. Intellectual property gives a person ownership over the things they create, the same way as something physical can be owned.
<br>
<br>
Most of your website, including the text, design, graphics, data, website layout and any music, broadcasts, software and images on your website, will be protected by copyright.
<br>
<br>
Copyright prevents people from:
copying your work
distributing copies of it, whether free of charge or for sale
renting or lending copies of your work
performing, showing or playing your work in public
making an adaptation of your work
putting it on the internet
<br>
<br>
A license is an agreement through which a licensee leases the rights to a legally protected piece of intellectual property from a licensor — the entity which owns or represents the property — for use in conjunction with a product or service.
<br>    
Copyright in something is infringed if it is reproduced in any material form. Therefore, you risk infringing copyright if you reproduce someone else's website content on your website without permission. Similarly, your copyright might be infringed if someone else reproduces your materials on their website without permission.
<br>
Intellectual property rights are a business asset, and are often the most valuable business asset. Any business presently trading or considering trading on the internet needs to check what intellectual property rights it owns and ensure that it is fully protected.
<br>
Upon conviction in the magistrates' court the maximum term of incarceration in the UK for copyright infringement is 6 months and/or a fine of up to £50,000. Upon conviction in the Crown Court the maximum term of incarceration in the UK for copyright infringement is 10 years and/or an "unlimited" fine.
<br>
When in doubt, seek permission.

<h3>1.6 | Describing access issues</h3>
<p class="outcome2">“The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”
<br>
<br>
When designing a website, you should take into consideration access issues for people with physical or mental disabilities of all kinds. Even if they are able to visit the website, you should ensure that everyone is able to navigate it. Disabilities that affect access to the internet include auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. Situational disability might also include, accessing the web on small screens, low light, temporary disabilities, poor internet connection.
<br>
<br>
Solutions to support inclusion for hearing disabilities, might include transcripts for audio files. For visual disabilities such as colour blindness you should avoid using solely green and red. However, individuals with learning difficulties benefit from the use of colour on websites. For those with neurological disorders, using headings, subheadings, and lists for structuring the information, shorter sentences, consistency in colors, font, and locations of the elements in the Webpage, keyboard support can all help to make navigation easier.
<br>
<br>
One way to improve user experience for individuals with disabilities, would be testing with real users.</p>

<br>
<h3>1.7 | Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<p class="outcome2">For visual content on your website, you could use a jpeg – the most common image file type generated by mobile phones or digital cameras. If you’re looking for a higher quality image a png, tiff or SVG file would be appropriate. File formats can be chosen on size restrictions, for example if you’re adding images to websites you want them to load as quickly as possible to improve SEO. For an animated moving image, you could use a GIF. For video, a mov, quicktime or mpeg file. For audio files, you would use a mp3 and mp4.
