    <p class="aboutme">My name's Jess. I bought my first piece of technology – a mobile phone – in 1996. As an early adopter, I've always been interested in how tech can revolutionise the way we do things.
    <br>
    <br>
    With a background in media, I understand the role technology plays in making communication possible. My job relies heavily on technology – be it social media to find stories and contact interviewees; collaboration software to share ideas with team members and file sharing sites to ensure that my content is delivered quickly, to tight deadlines.
