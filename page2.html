<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 1</h4>
<br>
<h3>1.1 | Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p class="outcome2">I decided to opt for a simple theme of pastel pink for a clean aesthetic. A busy background can detract from the content displayed and I drew on designs from professional organisations, which were quite streamlined. 
<br>
<br>I applied an image within a border of a nature-themed photograph is nature photography is something I enjoy. The content itself is black text to provide contrast away from the pastel pink background. I have aligned and centred all content for readability and aesthetics. I also created a border outside of the padding and margins to separate the colour scheme with a white box and reduced opacity so it doesn't just look empty and plain. I have clickable links to references and a contact me page.

<h3>1.5 | Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
<p class="outcome2">Finding stock objects is often quicker, cheaper and more practical than producing your own.
<br> 
<br>
Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual property. It allows the copyright owner to protect against others copying or reproducing their work. Intellectual property gives a person ownership over the things they create, the same way as something physical can be owned.
<br>
<br>
Most of a website, including the text, design, graphics, data, website layout and any music, broadcasts, software and images on your website, will be protected by copyright.

<h3>1.6 | Describing access issues</h3>
<p class="outcome2">“The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”
<br>
<br>
When designing a website, you should take into consideration access issues for people with physical or mental disabilities of all kinds. Even if they are able to visit the website, you should ensure that everyone is able to navigate it. 
<br>
<br>
Solutions to support inclusion for hearing disabilities, might include transcripts for audio files. For visual disabilities such as colour blindness you should avoid using solely green and red. However, individuals with learning difficulties benefit from the use of colour on websites. For those with neurological disorders, using headings, subheadings, and lists for structuring the information, shorter sentences, consistency in colors, font, and locations of the elements in the Webpage, keyboard support can all help to make navigation easier.
<br>
<br>
One way to improve user experience for individuals with disabilities, would be testing with real users.</p>

<h3>1.7 | Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<p class="outcome2">For visual content on your website, you could use a jpeg – the most common image file type generated by mobile phones or digital cameras. If you’re looking for a higher quality image a png, tiff or SVG file would be appropriate. File formats can be chosen on size restrictions, for example if you’re adding images to websites you want them to load as quickly as possible to improve SEO. For an animated moving image, you could use a GIF. For video, a mov, quicktime or mpeg file. For audio files, you would use a mp3 and mp4.

<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 2</h4>
<br>
<h3>2.1 | Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
<p class="outcome2">
    I mainly used Visual Studio Code for my website project. It was very fast and easy to use. Trello allowed me to keep on top of individual tasks. I sourced new CSS rules from the internet.
</p>
<br>
<h3>2.2 | Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Visual Studio Code was easy to use. I built the structure of the website with html and then styled it with a layer of css. 
</p>
</body>
</html>
<br>
<h3>2.3 | Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> I’m happy with the layout and colour scheme. However, it is still more basic than I would have liked because I’m new to html and css. I would have changed the font. 
</p>
</body>
</html>
<br>
<h3>2.4 | Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Visual Studio Code was easy to use. I built the structure of the website with html and then styled it with a layer of css.

<h3>2.5 | Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p class="outcome2"> Unsure what is meant here.

<h4>Unit 2 - Outcome 3</h4>
<br>
<h3>3.1 | Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p class="outcome2">Given that I have no previous experience of building a website, there are benefits to working in a team on the website project. I found this particularly useful with the game we devised, because cohort members were able to demonstrate how to write lines of code to those with no previous experience.

    However because of the personal nature of the website, there were benefits to doing this task alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It meant I could apply the styles and shape it in a way that I liked and that reflected my tastes, as well as encouraging independent learning.
    <br>
    The cohort has been useful for sharing code, so I would have drawn on this shared knowledge more in retrospect.    
</p>
<br>
<h3>3.2 | Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p class="outcome2">On reflection, I would have done more preparation by way of research into the layout and design of the website template. I could have done this by collating a list of references to websites that I thought were effective. I would have done more research on user journey and functionality.

    Peer review would have also been beneficial, as well as showing friends and family for an objective point of view. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In terms of efficiency I could have worked out a schedule for each task that contributed to building the website. I would have dedicated a certain amount of time to each task.       
</p>

<br>
<h3>3.3 | Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
<p class="outcome2">I think it is preferable to work in teams because you can allocate tasks and can learn from your peers. On reflection, I would have sought more support from my cohort. Slack would have been very useful for this. Trello is extremely useful for breaking down individual tasks, in holding you accountable for completing each one and it’s important to keep on top of Trello to ensure you are not neglecting/spending too much time on certain tasks.  
</p>

<br>
<h3>3.4 | Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<p class="outcome2">It's important to run through the website to see if everything works prior to publishing. This ensures you can pick up any bugs and errors, that clickable links take you the correct page. Should there be any errors you can then fix them and re-test. Once everything works without errors, the website is ready for publication.
